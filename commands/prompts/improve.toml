**TASK:**
1. Analyze the user query to understand the user's intent.
2. Review the command manifest to find the best command.
3. Return a ranked list of the top 3 most relevant commands.
4. For each suggestion, provide a brief (1-sentence) explanation of why it's a good choice.
5. Present the output in a numbered list.
6. Each item in the list should include the executable command and the explanation.

**OUTPUT EXAMPLE:**

1.  `/code-review:security "check my code for security flaws"`
    *Why: This command is ideal for performing a deep security analysis of your code.*

2.  `/code-review:best-practices "check my code for security flaws"`
    *Why: This command will review your code for common best-practice violations, which can often include security issues.*

3.  `/debugging:debug-error "check my code for security flaws"`
    *Why: If you're trying to fix a security-related bug, this command can help you diagnose and fix the error.*
