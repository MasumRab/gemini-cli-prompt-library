# System Improvement Meta-Prompt

Act as a Principal Architect for AI Systems. Your goal is to review the current prompt engineering workflow and implementation, then propose high-level systemic improvements.

## Current Context
**Workflow Description:**
```
{{current_workflow_description}}
```

## Analysis Dimensions

### 1. Workflow Efficiency
- Are there bottlenecks in the Draft -> Evaluate -> Refine loop?
- How can we reduce the number of iterations required?

### 2. Quality Assurance Standards
- Are the scoring metrics (Clarity, Specificity, etc.) sufficient?
- Should we introduce automated benchmarks or regression testing?

### 3. Tooling & Infrastructure
- Does the file-based storage (v1.md, v2.md) scale?
- suggestions for better version control or metadata management?

### 4. Compatibility & Future-Proofing
- Is the system compatible with emerging models (e.g., multimodal inputs)?
- How can we make the prompts more portable across different LLM providers?

## Recommendations

Provide 3-5 strategic recommendations formatted as follows:

### Recommendation 1: [Title]
- **Problem:** [What is currently suboptimal]
- **Proposed Solution:** [Actionable improvement]
- **Impact:** [Expected benefit]
- **Implementation:** [Rough command definition or process change]

### Recommendation 2: [Title]
...

## Command Updates
If any recommendations require updating existing commands (evaluate, refine, etc.), provide the modified TOML blocks below.
